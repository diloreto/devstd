		<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.deviationstandard.com/blog/2018-data-market-predictions/"><![CDATA[<h2>Understanding Market Trends</h2>
<p>Happy New Year friends! Now that all the fruit cake has disappeared, presents put away, and family members returning home, we decided to look to the future of the burgeoning data market. Since we&#8217;ve launched this website we&#8217;ve received hundreds of pieces of correspondence asking for our viewpoint on where this new vertical is heading, and decided to put together an obligatory &#8220;predictions&#8221; piece. Note that the following expectations are ours alone, and do not reflect any of the partners or companies that we work with. That in mind, here is our digital prognosis of this growing sector.</p>
<h2>Small Businesses Monetization Will Takeoff</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/big_data_monetization.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-8658 " src="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/big_data_monetization-300x200.jpg" alt="Big Data Monetization - DeviationStandard.com" width="350" height="233" srcset="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/big_data_monetization-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/big_data_monetization-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/big_data_monetization.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a></p>
<p>After speaking with dozens of small business owners in 2017 about their data monetization plans, we believe the market for SMB data will explode in 2018. Many small and medium  of all shapes and sizes have come to us, looking for innovative methods of turning their private, in-house data into sellable assets. Whether the business is a florist in Brooklyn or ice cream shop in San Francisco, we have begun working with many companies on understanding the benefits and process by which they can sell some of their information in a privacy and user-safe manner.</p>
<p>How will this nascent area of data monetization grow? By examining what information they have collected and working alongside our sell-side brokers, we are helping companies identify new revenue streams. It has been written time and time again that data is the <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world&#8217;s most valuable resource</a>, and companies that act on monetizing will have first-mover advantage on their competitors who do not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Blockchain Will Influence the Data Marketplace</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="blockchain, block, chain" src="https://pixabay.com/get/ea35b00629f6013ed95c4518b74b4391e176e1dc04b0144092f7c37ba5e8bd_640.png" alt="blockchain, block, chain" width="350" height="262" /> Companies all over the globe are racing to understand the value and potential of incorporating blockchain into their business models. While this nascent technology has still yet to be properly vetted (at the time of this article) as a secure and worthwhile venture, the potential is certainly apparent. Digital transactions can now take place without the need for a 3rd party intermediary (see: bank) anywhere in the world, in a secure and fast manner. This echoes the methods by which data sets are bought and sold, and could be a new conduit for commercialization.</p>
<p>If your business is interested in learning more how blockchain can be used to buy/sell data (or any asset) please <a href="https://www.deviationstandard.com/contact/">reach out to our research team</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>IoT Will Become the Centerpiece for Data Sourcing</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="network, iot, internet of things" src="https://pixabay.com/get/ee3db30828f31c2ad65a5854e1494194e274ebc818b4104692f2c37baeee_640.png" alt="network, iot, internet of things" width="351" height="228" />  This prediction &#8211; while not entire novel &#8211; is starting to unfold almost daily for businesses of all sizes. Companies are looking more and more to  IoT-connected devices as a new source of data and to grow their business. No longer is IoT regulated to technology or startups, but retail, CPG, and other verticals are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/12/19/the-top-8-iot-trends-for-2018/#24dcc3d167f7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving to it in droves</a>. Also, B2C IoT is not online the source of data, as B2B and internal IoT devices now are driving business decisions at all levels. Internet-connected trucks, online medical devices, and warehouse inventory management systems are popping up in companies of all sizes. Many leaders at large technology firms such as SAS, Salesforce and GE believe not only will IoT sources drive direct business decisions, but also be larger inputs into <a href="https://www.iotcentral.io/blog/40-predictions-for-the-internet-of-things-in-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">algorithms and predictive models</a>. As more and more SMBs begin to adopt and integrate IoT devices, we will see this submarket grow larger throughout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How has your company already started looking at either IoT, Blockchain or information monetization as value drivers this year? Are you equipped to take advantage of these amazing technologies to either reduce costs (overhead) or add new streams of revenue to your bottom line? <a href="https://www.deviationstandard.com/contact/">We&#8217;d love to hear more</a> on your 2018 data plans.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.deviationstandard.com/blog/growing-business-data-monetization/"><![CDATA[<p>A new <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/fueling-growth-through-data-monetization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey Global Survey</a> found that while companies are more data-focused than ever before, they are not maximizing the potential of their data assets. This is not atypical, as most businesses do not even realize the value of their owned data. We at Deviation Standard, are helping change that.</p>
<h2>Opportunity</h2>
<p>In the last few years, many businesses have been looking for new ways to grow, and do not understand the potential of monetizing their data. Usually the first question we receive when talking to companies interested is &#8220;how much is my data worth?&#8221;, a perfectly valid request. Similarly to a homeowner wanting to know the value of their property, many factors go into pricing a data asset. In fact, there are multiple methods for coming to a price on data, but ultimately it trickles back to supply and demand. Working with multiple companies, our team will scour our network to find the highest bidder for your data. Additionally, the value of the data opportunity is multiplied when there are multiple uses for the data. The survey found that most companies across industries only see value of data in sales &amp; marketing divisions, and while this is a primary use case and consumer of data, it is only scratching the surface. From the McKinsey study, sales and marketing teams have changed the most due to data and analytics, and surprisingly, materials and energy companies have benefited the most overall:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-11.39.16-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8684 size-large" src="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-11.39.16-AM-1024x861.png" alt="" width="1024" height="861" srcset="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-11.39.16-AM-1024x861.png 1024w, https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-11.39.16-AM-300x252.png 300w, https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-06-at-11.39.16-AM-768x646.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Our Stance</h2>
<p>As data monetization is one of our core pillars at Deviation Standard, we are aligned with McKinsey&#8217;s findings and remarks regarding the type of businesses that succeed and the importance of the practice. Echoing a takeaway from the report, <em>Data monetization is becoming a differentiator</em> in businesses of all shapes and sizes. Additionally, <em>data monetization seems to correlate with industry-leading performance, </em>something that we have also noticed in the companies that we work with. Those that are more forward-thinking and progressive when it comes to their information program have found success legally and intelligently monetizing their data.</p>
<p>However, data monetization does have its limitations, especially within the confines of certain industries. Monetizing users&#8217; financial data, even anonymously, is much riskier than browsing behavior perhaps, and should carry additional scrutiny when doing so. In general, we ensure that for each transaction that our customers engage in, that theirs, as well as the users&#8217; information contained in the data, are completely privatized and protected, removing any and all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personally identifiable information</a> (PII) and sensitive personal information (SPI). We also adhere to the <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/?topic=iab-data-center-of-excellence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAB&#8217;s standards for data sharing</a> and activation, for all media-focused data transactions. When taking this stance, privacy is retained, integrity intact, and success is optimized.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.deviationstandard.com/blog/take-data-broker-accountability-transparency-act-2017/"><![CDATA[<p>In response to the recent data breach of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16270808/equifax-data-breach-us-identity-theft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">143 million users&#8217; private information</a> on the credit reporting agency <a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equifax</a>, Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass,), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Al Franken (D-Minn.) <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Data%20Brokers%20legislation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed a bill</a> that would give consumers the right to prevent their information from being sold by data brokers, as well as require data brokers to disclose and destroy consumers&#8217; private information.<span id="more-8636"></span></p>
<p>This is not the first time that congress has attempted to pass data privacy acts in the recent past; Senator John D. Rockefeller (D-W.V.) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed a similar bill in 2014</a>, Senator Markey attempted <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/668" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in 2015</a>, and most recently, Representative Henry &#8220;Hank&#8221; Johnson Jr. (D-G.A.) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4516" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a similar bill in 2016</a>. All 3 laws were eventually killed in one house or the other, but now lawmakers are leveraging the aforementioned data hack as a lighting rod to push through this year&#8217;s edition. As a service provider and partner to many &#8220;traditional&#8221; data brokerages, as well as a company that brokers information deals, Deviation Standard is obviously in the thick of this. We would like to clarify our stance on the proposed legislation and what it means to the industry.</p>
<p>We at Deviation Standard, first and foremost, believe in an open and transparent information marketplace, where consumers can opt in or out as they so please. We believe that this openness creates a better market, and allows choice for the end user. While it may seem that by opting out of data collection would not be in our best interest, agreeing for data protection is a fundamental belief of not only this company but the United States of America. We at Deviation Standard strive to work with only reputable, transparent data providers &amp; aggregators, those that honor consumers&#8217; choices. Opting out might reduce the number of users that are able to be marketed intelligently, but creates a more powerful and fair marketplace for advertisers looking to provide consumers with the best product at the best price. Additionally, while anonymized user data is a key tenant to our business, we work with <strong>many</strong> different kinds of data, reports, and analyses, all delivered at different levels of granularity.</p>
<p>Finally, by agreeing to and promoting a more open data environment, it allows for creativity and uniqueness of our data partners, which further enhances the products and services we can offer our customers. Customers can feel assured that the information procured was done so with the end-consumers&#8217; consensus, which should increase the likelihood of engagement and eventually, conversion. Please check out our <a href="https://www.deviationstandard.com/about-us/partners/">partners</a> page for more information or feel free to <a href="https://www.deviationstandard.com/contact/">contact us</a> to speak directly.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.deviationstandard.com/blog/really-data-broker/"><![CDATA[<p>The first question that we get here all the time, rightfully so, is &#8220;can you explain to me what a <strong>Data Broker</strong> <em>is</em>?&#8221;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_broker">Wikipedia</a> describes data brokers (&#8220;Infomation Brokers&#8221;) as individuals that &#8220;collect information about individuals from public records and private sources including census and change of address records, motor vehicle and driving records, user-contributed material to social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, media and court reports, voter registration lists, consumer purchase histories, most-wanted lists and terrorist watch lists, bank card transaction records, health care authorities, and web browsing histories.&#8221; Terrorist watch lists? Sounds quite daunting.</p>
<p><span id="more-8491"></span></p>
<p>We at Deviation Standard like to redefine the meaning of data brokers by using the definition of a real estate agent for information, or as described on Wikipedia: &#8220;A real estate broker or real estate salesperson is a person who acts as an <strong>intermediary</strong> between <strong>sellers</strong> and <strong>buyers</strong> of real estate/real property and attempts to <strong>match up</strong> sellers who wish to sell and buyers who wish to buy.&#8221; That&#8217;s it. No more, no less. Take that definition and replace &#8220;real estate&#8221; for &#8220;data&#8221; and you have a solid understanding of our core business. In order to best understand what our team of data brokers do, and how they can help your business grow, it is best to examine our 3 core competencies.</p>
<h2>Data Procurement</h2>
<p>Data Procurement, or the buy side of a data broker&#8217;s job, involves sourcing, negotiating, transporting and delivery of your information. The process can be understood graphically via the buy-side cycle that we adhere to:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/data-procurement-monetization-lifecycle.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-8739 size-staff_tn" src="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/data-procurement-monetization-lifecycle-570x570.png" alt="Data Procurement Lifecycle - DeviationStandard.com" width="570" height="570" srcset="https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/data-procurement-monetization-lifecycle-570x570.png 570w, https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/data-procurement-monetization-lifecycle-150x150.png 150w, https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/data-procurement-monetization-lifecycle-300x300.png 300w, https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/data-procurement-monetization-lifecycle-768x768.png 768w, https://www.deviationstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/data-procurement-monetization-lifecycle.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></a></h2>
<p>Within the lifecycle, there are 8 steps in our process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Business Goals Discussion</strong> &#8211; We will sit down and work with your team to understand exactly your company/team/project&#8217;s objectives and how to define success, and how &amp; where the information will be used. Our team will make recommendations and provide industry guidance on best practices, prices, and timelines.</li>
<li><strong>Data Search</strong> &#8211; After understanding your goals, we will begin to scour our network of data aggregators, resellers, and niche data providers to obtain the necessary information. The partnerships we have built allow our Data Brokers priority access and premium pricing throughout the industry.</li>
<li><strong>New Provider Enablement</strong> &#8211; In the event that one of our data partners does not carry the information your business needs, we will begin an external search and establish terms with new providers as necessary on your behalf.</li>
<li><strong>Deal Arrangement</strong> &#8211; Once the assets are identified, we will work with your team to review each opportunity and discuss pros/cons, delivery and payment. We work as an intermediary to establish terms (legal &amp; financial) of the sale of data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transformation</strong> &#8211; To best help your company leverage your new asset immediately, we can work on your behalf to reshape, pivot, or augment the dataset before delivery, saving your team time and money.</li>
<li><strong>Data Delivery</strong> &#8211; Upon successful transmission and transformation of your dataset, we will then work with your team to deliver the asset in a storage facility of your choice, whether it be on premise server, cloud database, or flat file.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery Completion</strong> &#8211; After the data have been delivered to your team, we will follow up to ensure customer satisfaction and utility of your new information.</li>
<li><strong>Data Usage</strong> &#8211; At this point your information will now be at your disposal for any and all use as defined by the terms and conditions in #4.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Data Monetization</h2>
<p>The sell side of a Data Broker&#8217;s job is very similar to the buy side, but obviously now he or she is attempting to identify buyers instead of sellers of data. We will work closely with your technology or marketing teams to identify sellable assets, conduct market research and demand planning, and help forecast competitive pricing of your data. We will also ensure all sales are completed in a privacy-safe and industry-compliant manner. If the sale of data requires a 3rd party team (such as a <a href="https://digiday.com/media/what-is-a-dmp-data-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Management Platform</a>, Agency, or similar), our team of Data Brokers will represent your company or alongside your resources to ensure successful transmission. Again, similar to data purchasing, we will work to establish terms based on your corporate guidelines.</p>

<h2>Data Science</h2>
<p>At the core of each data brokers&#8217; skillset lies the mathematics and science of information management. Our team of highly skilled experts can help provide strategic guidance on the storage, transformation, and usage of your newly acquired digital asset. Whether your goal is to conduct industry analyses, demand planning or forecasting, digital marketing or beyond, we can work with your team every step of the way. Being your data agency of record, we will act as an extension of your team with any 3rd party companies or partners, ensuring a successful project completion. As the range of services required can vary greatly, we suggest <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.deviationstandard.com/contact/">contacting us</a></strong></span> for a free consultation.</p>

			<p>You may purchase phone plans with more than enough data to cover things like casual web surfing and streaming the occasional song. But you may not realize that browsing Facebook could be a big hit against your data plan too.</p>
<p>According to Cisco&#8217;s online VNI Services Gauge Tool, one hour of browsing through social media can use up 90 megabytes, which is more than twice the amount of data that streaming music uses in the standard &#8220;normal&#8221; quality per hour..</p>

			<p>It means that if you spend an hour a day on social media over a cellular network, you could be using 2.7 GB of data a month. Even half an hour of daily social media browsing could consumer 1.35 GB.</p>
<p>A lot of that usage is likely due to the auto-play video Facebook recently added to its app. The videos appear at different rates for each user based on a variety of factors in Facebook&#8217;s newsfeed algorithm. Twitter is also said to have a similar feature coming to its feed soon.</p>
<p>You can disable the auto-play option for newsfeed videos when you&#8217;re on a cellular network by going in to the Facebook app and tapping the options button (the three horizontal lines on top of each other) found on the bottom right for the iOS version, and towards the top right for the Android version. Then tap Account Settings &gt; Videos and Photos &gt; Auto-play &gt; disable Smart Auto-play &gt; and tap Use Wi-Fi Only.</p>

			<p>Streaming music at the normal, average stream quality for an hour will use up 43 megabytes of your data plan per hour. It may seem insignificant, but it equates to about 1.3 GB of your plan per month if you stream music every day for an hour over your carrier&#8217;s cell network. Some streaming services stream music at a lower 64 kbps, which uses up less data.</p>
<p>And if you prefer to stream music in higher quality (at 320 kbps) when you&#8217;re not connected to a WiFi network, you&#8217;re looking at 144 megabytes per hour. That&#8217;s 4.32 GB per month if you stream high quality music every day for an hour over a cellular network.</p>

<p>And if you prefer to stream music in higher quality (at 320 kbps) when you&#8217;re not connected to a WiFi network, you&#8217;re looking at 144 megabytes per hour. That&#8217;s 4.32 GB per month if you stream high quality music every day for an hour over a cellular network.</p>
<p>You may purchase phone plans with more than enough data to cover things like casual web surfing and streaming the occasional song.</p>
<blockquote><p>
If today were the last day of your life, would you want to do what you are about to do today?
</p></blockquote>
<p>But you may not realize that browsing Facebook could be a big hit against your data plan too.</p>
<p>According to Cisco&#8217;s online VNI Services Gauge Tool, one hour of browsing through social media can use up 90 megabytes, which is more than twice the amount of data that streaming music uses in the standard &#8220;normal&#8221; quality per hour.</p>
<p>It means that if you spend an hour a day on social media over a cellular network, you could be using 2.7 GB of data a month. Even half an hour of daily social media browsing could consumer 1.35 GB.</p>
<p>A lot of that usage is likely due to the auto-play video Facebook recently added to its app. The videos appear at different rates for each user based on a variety of factors in Facebook&#8217;s newsfeed algorithm. Twitter is also said to have a similar feature coming to its feed soon.</p>
